#Custom filter

A custom filter is a function that returns a function.
Use the filter function to create a custom filter.

Example: Create a custom filter to convert integer values 1,2,3 to Male, Female, and Not disclosed respectively.

See scriptA.js, indexA.html and stylesA.css how this is implemented.

Example: Same as before but this time keeping the filter in its own source file

See scriptB.js, indexB.html and stylesBA.css how this is implemented.
